# Sohapp
An online payment manager app to help users stay on top of their payments and the business owner to get money back on time and keep track of payments.

## For Users
Users can log in to see the amount of money they have loaned, and the proportion of this loan that they have repaid. The user can also track their transaction history, and use an integrated payment API to make further payments.

## For Business Owners
The app will allow Business Owners to track their loans, and easilly contact users who are failing to repay. 

The Business Owner can use the app to keep track of the money they have lent. The business owner can immediately view outstanding repayments for the present month and all overdue repayments. Other views allow the business owner to view details on specific Users, and see loans and repayments by batch (cohort).
